 To-Do List Application Development

We're excited to have you on board, and for your first project, we have a classic but essential task: developing a To-Do List Application.

Project Overview:
Your task is to create a To-Do List Application in Python. This application should allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, update task descriptions, and remove tasks from the list. You can choose whether to make it a command-line application or implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for added challenge.

Project Details:
1. Add Tasks: Users should be able to add new tasks to the to-do list. Each task should have a description and can be assigned a due date or priority.

2. Task List Display: Create a feature to display the list of tasks, including details like task description, due date, and priority.

3. Task Completion: Users should have the ability to mark tasks as completed, which will move them to a separate completed tasks list.

4. Update Tasks: Allow users to update task descriptions, due dates, or priorities.

5. Remove Tasks: Implement the option to remove tasks from the list.
